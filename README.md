# Web programming - JavaScript Assignment

This solution was submitted and created by the above student for the Web Programming course. I declare that this solution is my own work. I have not copied or used any third party solutions. I did not forward my solution to my fellow students, nor did I publish it. The Student Requirements System of Eötvös Loránd University of Applied Sciences (ELTE Organizational and Operational Regulations, Volume II, § 74/C) states that as long as a student presents the work - or at least a significant part of it - of another student as his/her own work, it is a disciplinary offence. The most serious consequence of a disciplinary offence is dismissal from the university.
